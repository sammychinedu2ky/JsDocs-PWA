This project illustrates web deployment using PWA techniques to powerup a webpage with caching abilities using sevice worker and a manifest file for installation.

This project contains a branch that details how to make this process easy using a tool called **"Service Worker"** .

You can try writing the code to set up the PWA abilities manually but the use of a Servie Worker makes this process quite easy and seemless.

You can check out the deployment  [here](https://priceless-wilson-cbf7e8.netlify.com/)
